              <p>Most of our daily activities became less stressful due to modern household appliances invented to do most of the domestic chores for us. All the activities that used to require a lot of time in the past stopped being noticeable in the present day as they are being accomplished by the household appliances. Humans are gradually moving towards becoming a more advanced civilization, and we should thank inventors of developed home appliances for that as most of them were made to ease the burden of the inventor. For instance, the dishwasher was invented by Josephine Garies, a wealthy woman who loved entertaining visitors, leaving a vast amount of dirty dishes for the maid. As the cleaning process was too slow, instead of employing more workers she came up with the innovative idea of having an appliance or machine that can clean her dishes in fully automated mode. Therefore, she checked all the markets to get one, but unfortunately, she could not get any. Later on, she thinks of venturing into producing washing machines. She was a wealthy woman, and luckily all the investments she made paid off. In the year 1886, her factory finally invents a properly operating dishwasher. Thus, this and other innovative appliances had started making it simpler for households to complete their daily routines.</p>
